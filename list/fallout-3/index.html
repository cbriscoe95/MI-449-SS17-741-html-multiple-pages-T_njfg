    <h1>Fallout 3</h1>
    <p>
      Fallout 3 is one of the first RPGs I remember playing. It was a great
      introduction to the genre which bridged FPS with RPG in a way that made
      the systems simple but still allowed for player freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great gateway into more traditional CRPGs that I've enjoyed since
      like Baldur's Gate and new titles like Pillars of Eternity.
