    <h1>Mass Effect 2</h1>
    <p>
      Mass Effect 2 took everything that made Mass Effect 1 great and added
      better combat, better graphics and a more reactive story. It was a such a
      huge jump in presentation quality while still maintaining most of the RPG
      elements that made the game so great.
